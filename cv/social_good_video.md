## Description

In the PhD course [Using maths and computer science to do social good](https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/51420){:target="_blank"}
we worked on a video in which we explain how machine learning works on a high level. As an example we use a medical 
classification of heart attacks to show how this technique can help to save lives.

We aim to school students of age 14 to 16, which know what a straight line of linear function is. From this knowledge
we generalize the concept in an intuitive and visual compelling way. We have developed a video in english, swedish and
accompanying interactive blog posts in english and swedish.
