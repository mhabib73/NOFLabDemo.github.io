**April 25, 2025 New Preprint**: First paper on SBI. We integrate the latest foundation model
for tabular data, TabPFN, for the use of Bayesian inference, specifically for SBI.\

**Dezember 11, 2024, SBI hackathon**: We organize a hackathon on the SBI toolbox that we maintain.
 The hackathon is remote and on-site at the University of Tübingen during 17-21 March 2025.\

**May 2, 2024, Accepted Paper**: Our high-dimensional analysis paper got accepted to ICML. We study the combination of
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with linear regression on data from a spiked covariance model to provide precise
asymptotic guarantees for the risk.\

**May 11, 2023, Accepted Paper**: Our paper on invertible kernel PCA got accepted at IEEE Signal Processing Letters.
We present a simple but effective method to invert the kernel PCA operations in an invertible subdomain which is
sufficient for reconstruction in many scenarios.\
