## Abstract

Deep state space models (SSMs) are an actively researched model class for temporal 
models developed in the deep learning community which have a close connection to classic SSMs. 
The use of deep SSMs as a black-box identification model can describe a wide range of dynamics 
due to the flexibility of deep neural networks. Additionally, the probabilistic nature of the model 
class allows the uncertainty of the system to be modelled. In this work a deep SSM class and 
its parameter learning algorithm are explained in an effort to extend the toolbox of nonlinear 
identification methods with a deep learning based method. Six recent deep SSMs are evaluated 
in a first unified implementation on nonlinear system identification benchmarks.
