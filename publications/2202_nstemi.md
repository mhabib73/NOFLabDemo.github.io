## Abstract

TBD

---
This is a working manuscript and will be the full paper for the workshop paper 
[ResNet-based ECG Diagnosis of Myocardial Infarction in the Emergency Department](/publications/2112_nstemiworkshop/). 
In the full paper, we extend the patient group from the coronary care unit patient in the workshop paper 
to all patients at the emergency department which increases the control pool massively.
